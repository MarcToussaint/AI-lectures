\textbf{Comment:} Solving problems in the real world involves 2 parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1)] formulating the problem as an optimization problem (conform to a
standard optimization problem category) ($\to$ human)
\item[2)] the actual optimization problem ($\to$ algorithm)
\end{enumerate}

These exercises focus on the first type, which is just as important as the
second, as it enables the use of a wider range of solvers.  Exercises from Boyd
et al \url{http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf}:

\exsection{Network flow problem}

Solve Exercise 4.12 (pdf page 193) from  Boyd \& Vandenberghe,
\emph{Convex Optimization.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\exsection{Minimum fuel optimal control}

Solve Exercise 4.16 (pdf page 194) from  Boyd \& Vandenberghe,
\emph{Convex Optimization.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\exsection{Reformulating an $\ell_1$-norm}

(This is a subset of  Exercise 4.11 (pdf page 193) from  Boyd \& Vandenberghe.)

Let $x\in\RRR^n$. The optimization problem is $\min_x \norm{x-b}_1$,
where the $\ell_1$-norm is defined as $\norm{z}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n
|z_i|$. Reformulate this optimization problem as a Linear Program.

%% \exsection{ Solve one of these only, the otheres are optional}

%% a) Grocery Shopping: You're at the market and you find $n$ offers,
%% each represented by a set of items $A_i$ and the respective price
%% $c_i$. Your goal is to buy at least one of each item for as little as
%% possible. Formulate as an integer LP.

%% b) Facility Location: There are $n$ facilities with which to satisfy the needs of $m$ clients.  The
%% cost for opening facility $j$ is $f_j$, and the cost for servicing client $i$
%% through facility $j$ is $c_{ij}$.  You have to find an optimal way to open
%% facilities and to associate clients to facilities. Formulate as an ILP.

%% c) Taxicab Driver: You're a taxicab driver in hyper-space ($\RRR^d$)
%% and have to service $n$ clients.  Each client $i$ has a known initial
%% position $c_i\in\RRR^d$ and a destination $d_i\in\RRR^d$.  You start
%% out at position $p_0\in\RRR^d$ and have to service all the clients
%% while minimizing fuel use, which is proportional to covered distance.
%% Hyper-space is funny, so the geometry is not Euclidean and distances
%% are Manhattan distances. Formulate as an LP.
