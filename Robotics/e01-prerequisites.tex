No need to prepare for this first tutorial. We'll do the exercises together on the fly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\exsection{Prerequisites: Matrix equations}

a) Let $X,A$ be arbitrary matrices, $A$ invertible. Solve for $X$:
$$ X A + A^\T = \Id $$


b) Let $X,A,B$ be arbitrary matrices, $(C-2A^\T)$ invertible. Solve for $X$:
$$ X^\T C = [2 A (X + B)]^\T $$


c) Let $x\in\RRR^n,y\in\RRR^d,A\in\RRR^{d\times n}$. $A$ obviously \emph{not}
invertible, but let $A^\T A$ be invertible. Solve for $x$:
$$ (A x - y)^\T A = \vec 0_n^\T $$


d) As above, additionally $B\in\RRR^{n\times n}$, $B$
positive-definite. Solve for $x$: 
$$ (A x - y)^\T A + x^\T B = \vec 0_n^\T $$


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\exsection{Prerequisites: Vector derivatives}

Let $x\in\RRR^n,~ y\in\RRR^d,~ f,g: \RRR^n \to \RRR^d,~
A\in\RRR^{d\times n},~ C \in \RRR^{d \times d}$. (Also provide the dimensionality of the results.)

a) What is $\frac{\del}{\del x} x$ ~?


b) What is $\frac{\del}{\del x}[x^\T x]$ ~?


c) What is $\frac{\del}{\del x}[f(x)^\T f(x)]$ ~?


d) What is $\frac{\del}{\del x}[f(x)^\T C g(x)]$ ~?


e) Let $B$ and $C$ be symmetric (and pos.def.). What is the minimum of $(Ax -
y)^\T C (Ax - y) + x^\T B x$ ?


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\exsection{Optimization}

Given $x\in\RRR^n,~ f:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR$, we want to find $\argmin_x f(x)$.  (We assume $f$ is uni-modal.)

a) What 1st-order optimization methods (querying $f(x),\na f(x)$ in each iteration) do you know?


b) What 2nd-order optimization methods (querying $f(x),\na f(x), \he
f(x)$ in each iteration) do you know?


c) What is backtracking line search?
