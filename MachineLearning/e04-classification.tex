\exsection{Logistic Regression (6 Points)}

On the course webpage there is a data set @data2Class.txt@ for a binary
classification problem. Each line contains a data entry $(x,y)$ with
$x\in\RRR^2$ and $y\in\{0,1\}$.

a) Compute the optimal parameters $\b$ and the mean neg-log-likelihood
$- \frac{1}{n} \log L(\b)$ for logistic regression using linear
features. Plot the probability $P(y=1 \| x)$ over a 2D grid of test
points. (4 P)

\begin{itemize}
\item Recall the objective function, and its gradient and Hessian that
we derived in the last exercise:
\begin{align}
L(\b)
&= - \sum_{i=1}^n \log P(y_i \| x_i) + \l\norm{\b}^2 \\
&= - \sum_{i=1}^n \[ y_i \log p_i + (1-y_i) \log [1-p_i]\] + \l\norm{\b}^2 \\
\na L(\b)
&= \frac{\del L(\b)}{\del \b}^\T
 = \sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - y_i)~ \phi(x_i) + 2\l I \b
 = X^\T (p - y) + 2\l I \b \\
\he L(\b)
&= \frac{\del^2 L(\b)}{\del \b^2}
 = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(1-p_i)~ \phi(x_i)~ \phi(x_i)^\T + 2\l I
 = X^\T W X + 2 \l I \\
\text{where}
 &~ p(x) := P(y\=1 \| x) = \s(\phi(x)^\T \b),~
 p_i := p(x_i),~
 W := \diag(p\circ(1-p))
\end{align}

\item Setting the gradient equal to zero can't be done
 analytically. Instead, optimal parameters can quickly be found by
 iterating Newton steps: For this, initialize $\b=0$ and iterate
\begin{align}
\b \gets \b - (\he L(\b))^\1~ \na L(\b) ~.
\end{align}
You usually need to iterate only a few times ($\sim$10) til
convergence.
\item As you did for regression, plot the discriminative function
$f(x) = \phi(x)^\T \b$ or the class probability function $p(x)
= \s(f(x))$ over a grid.
\end{itemize}

Useful gnuplot commands:

\begin{code}%[fontsize=\tiny,numbers=none,xleftmargin=2ex] 
\begin{verbatim}
splot [-2:3][-2:3][-3:3.5] 'model' matrix \
   us ($1/20-2):($2/20-2):3 with lines notitle
plot [-2:3][-2:3] 'data2Class.txt' \
   us 1:2:3 with points pt 2 lc variable title 'train'
\end{verbatim}
\end{code}


b) Compute and plot the same for quadratic features. (2 P)

\exsection{Structured Output (4 Points)}

(Warning: This is one of these exercises that do not have ``one correct solution''.)

Consider data of tuples $(x,y_1,y_2)$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item $x\in\RRR^d$ is the age and some other features of a spotify user
\item $y_1\in\RRR$ quantifies how much the user likes
  HipHop
\item $y_2\in\RRR$ quantifies how much the user likes
  Classic
\end{itemize}
Naively one could train separate regressions $x\mapsto y_1$ and
$x\mapsto y_2$. However, it seems reasonable that somebody that likes
HipHop might like Classic a bit less than average (anti-correlated).

a) Properly define a \emph{representation} and \emph{objective} for
modelling the prediction $x \mapsto (y_1, y_2)$. (2 P)

Tip: Discriminative functions $f(y,x)$ can not only be used to define a class prediction $F(x) = \argmax_y f(y,x)$, but equally also continuous predictions where $y\in\RRR$ or $y\in\RRR^O$. How can you setup and parameterize a discriminative function for the mapping $x \mapsto (y_1, y_2)$?

b) Assume you would not only like to make a deterministic prediction $x \mapsto (y_1, y_2)$, but map $x$ to a probability distribution $p(y_1,y_2|x)$, where presumably $y_1$ and $y_2$ would be anti-correlated. How can this be done? (2 P)

c) Extra: Assume that the data set would contain a third output variable $y_3\in\{0,1\}$, e.g.\ $y_3$ may indicate whether the user pays for music. How could you setup learning a model $x \mapsto (y_1, y_2, y_3)$?

d) Extra: General discussion: Based on this, how are regression, classification, and conditional random fields related?

\exsection{Extra: Discriminative Function in Logistic Regression}

Logistic Regression (slide 03:19) defines class probabilities as proportional to
the exponential of a discriminative function:
$$P(y|x) = \frac{\exp f(x, y)}{\sum_{y'}\exp f(x, y')}$$

Prove that, in the binary classification case, you can assume $f(x, 0) = 0$
without loss of generality.  

This results in $$P(y=1|x) = \frac{\exp f(x, 1)}{1 + \exp f(x, 1)} =
\sigma(f(x, 1)).$$

(Hint: first assume $f(x, y) = \phi(x, y)^\T\beta$, and then define a new
discriminative function $f'$ as a function of the old one, such that $f'(x,
0)=0$ and for which $P(y|x)$ maintains the same expressibility.)

\exsection{Extra: Special cases of CRFs}

Slide 03:31 summarizes the core equations for CRFs.

a) Confirm the given equations for $\na_\b Z(x,\b)$ and $\he[\b]
Z(x,\b)$ (i.e., derive them from the definition of $Z(x,\b)$).

b) Binary logistic regression is clearly a special case of
CRFs. Sanity check that the gradient and Hessian given on slide 03:20
can alternatively be derived from the general expressions for $\na_\b L(\b)$ and
$\he[\b] L(\b)$ on slide 03:31. (The same is true for the multi-class case .)

c) Proof that ordinary ridge regression is a special case of CRFs if
you choose the discriminative function $f(x,y) = - y^2 + 2 y \phi(x)^\T \b$.
