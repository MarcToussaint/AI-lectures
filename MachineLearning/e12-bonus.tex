\exsection{Autoencoder (7 Points)}

On the webpage find and download the Yale face database
{\tiny\url{http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/teaching/data/yalefaces_cropBackground.tgz}}. The
file contains gif images of 136 faces.

We want to compare two methods (Autoencoder vs PCA) to reduce the dimensionality
of this dataset. This means that we want to create and train a neural network to
find a lower-dimensional representation of our data. Recall the slides and exercises
about dimensionality reduction, neural networks and especially Autoencoders
(slide 06:10).

a) Create a neural network using tensorflow (or any other framework, e.g., keras) which
takes the images as input, creates a lower-dimensional representation with dimensionality
$p=60$ in the hidden layer (i.e., a layer with $60$ neurons) and outputs the reconstructed
images. The loss function should compare the original image with the reconstructed
one. After having trained the network, reconstruct all faces and display some examples.
Report the reconstruction error $\sum_{i=1}^n \norm{x_i - x'_i}^2$. (5P)

b) Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to $p=60$ as well (e.g. use your
code from exercise e08:02). Reconstruct all faces using PCA and display some examples.
Report the reconstruction error $\sum_{i=1}^n \norm{x_i - x'_i}^2$. Compare the
reconstructions and the error from PCA with the results from the Autoencoder. Which
one works better? (2P)

Extra) Repeat for various dimensions $p=5, 10, 15, 20\ldots$


\exsection{Special cases of CRFs (3 Points)}

Slide 03:31 summarizes the core equations for CRFs.

a) Confirm the given equations for $\na_\b Z(x,\b)$ and $\he[\b]
Z(x,\b)$ (i.e., derive them from the definition of $Z(x,\b)$). (1P)

b) Binary logistic regression is clearly a special case of
CRFs. Sanity check that the gradient and Hessian given on slide 03:20
can alternatively be derived from the general expressions for $\na_\b L(\b)$ and
$\he[\b] L(\b)$ on slide 03:31. (The same is true for the multi-class case.) (1P)

c) Proof that ordinary ridge regression is a special case of CRFs if
you choose the discriminative function $f(x,y) = - y^2 + 2 y \phi(x)^\T \b$. (1P)
