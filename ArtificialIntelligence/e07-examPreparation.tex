\exsection{Notes on exam and previous exercises}

There will be about 6 questions (say, 5 to 7 questions). Questions will be  similar to those in the tutorial exercise sheets.

The rules will be: ``You may only use your pen and the given
paper. Don't use pencil or red colour. No other materials or devices
(no textbook, script, calculator, or mobile) are allowed.''

For preparation you should go through all tutorial exercises again. Let me comment on them:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ex 1.1 (Marginals \& Conditionals) and Ex 1.2 (Bayes' Theorem) are typical small questions in the exam -- you should be able to compute such marginals, conditionals, posteriors.
\item Ex 1.3 -- you should know the definitions of mean and variance

\item Ex 2.1 b) and c) are typical bandit question also for the exam. Since you can't use a book, you should memorize UCB1. (If necessary, we provide a table of approximate log values.)

\item No pure linear algebra questions (Ex 2.2) in the exam.

\item Ex 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2 are typical major questions, where from a text description of a decision process you have to formulate the model (decision tree or MDP), and then compute some values. There will definitely be questions like this.

\item Similarly Ex 5.1 is a typical example for a RL question: Simulate value updates (of Q-learning or TD-learning) in a very small maze for a few given transitions, and then report on the resulting state values. Optionally also how $n$-step updates or replay change this.

\item Ex 3.3 (Linear Regression) and the questions in Ex 6.1 are also typical questions that relate to ML or computation graphs. Applying chain rules and deriving the solution to a (very simple) ML problem are example questions.
\end{itemize}

The provided test exam gives explicit examples of questions and the format of the exam. The test exam (with only 5 questions) is probably slightly shorter than a real one.

%% \exsection{Q-Iteration}

%% Consider the following maze:\vspace{.5em}

%% \show[.5]{mouseMaze3}

%% We distinguish 7 states $s_1,..,s_7$ in the maze. 
%% In the states $s_1, s_2, s_3$, the mouse can choose between two actions: left or right.
%% With probability 3/4 the mouse will transition to the desired state, with probability 1/4 to the state in opposite direction.
%% The remaining four states are terminal states and the mouse can not choose an action (denoted as \textit{nil}).
%% The rewards are defined as follows: 

%% $$R(s_1, \mbox{left})=R(s_1, \mbox{right})=R(s_2, \mbox{left})=R(s_2, \mbox{right})=R(s_3, \mbox{left})=R(s_3, \mbox{right})=0$$
%% $$R(s_4, \mbox{nil})=16 \comma R(s_5, \mbox{nil})=0 \comma R(s_6, \mbox{nil})=1 \comma R(s_7, \mbox{nil})=5$$

%% The discount factor is $\gamma=0.5$.

%% \exsection{Upper Confidence Bound for Bandits}

%% Assume you have 3 bandits. You have already collected a few data points
%% from these bandits:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item From bandit 1: ~ 1 5 5 1
%% \item From bandit 2: ~ 2 3 2 3
%% \item From bandit 3: ~ 1 4 3 2 2 1 4 3
%% \end{itemize}

%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item Provide the UCB1 scores for each of the three bandits. Replace the
%% $\ln$ by $\log_2$ for simpler calculation by hand and use
%% $\b=1$. Write the solution in the box (expressions with $\sqrt{~}$ are OK):
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item UCB1 score for bandit 1:  \BOX{20ex}{4ex}
%%     \item UCB1 score for bandit 2:  \BOX{20ex}{4ex}
%%     \item UCB1 score for bandit 3:  \BOX{20ex}{4ex}
%% \end{itemize}

%% \item Which bandit should be played next if you can play \textbf{infinitely often} and
%% the goal is to maximize the expected reward. Explain your decision.\\
%%     \BOX{110ex}{10ex}

%% \item Which bandit should be played next if you can only play \textbf{once more}
%%  and the goal is to maximize the expected reward. Explain your decision.\\
%%     \BOX{110ex}{10ex}
%% \end{enumerate}

%% \begin{solution}
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item UCB1-B1: $3 + \sqrt{2}$
%%     \item UCB1-B2: $2.5 + \sqrt{2}$
%%     \item UCB1-B3: $2.5 + \sqrt{1}$
%% \end{itemize}
