\exsection{General Pointers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Here is a list of reference material I recommend (mostly for MSc level courses) on Linear Algebra, Probabilities, ML basics, \& Optimization:

\url{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/#reference-material}

\item Here are compilations of own material:
\begin{items}
\item \href{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-Maths.pdf}{Maths for Intelligent Systems} (Brief reference for Linear Algebra, Optimization & Probabilities)
\item \href{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-Optimization.pdf}{Introduction to Optimization}
\item \href{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-MachineLearning.pdf}{Introduction to Machine Learning}
\item \href{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-Robotics.pdf}{Introduction to Robotics}
\item \href{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-AI.pdf}{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}
\end{items}
\end{itemize}

\exsection{Concrete Literature on Lecture Topics}

Here some more concrete literature recommentations following the structure of the course:

\begin{itemize}
\item Probabilities:
\begin{items}
\item Basics: Bishop (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning), section 1.2 (until 1.2.4), available online (just google, or visit Bishop's page:
\url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/})

The book also introduces to much more details of various probability distributions and probabilistic inference.
\item Russel \& Norwig (\url{https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs470/materials/aima2010.pdf}) has a mini section Appendix A.3, but not very helpful
\end{items}

\item Decision Theory
\begin{items}
\item Russel \& Norwig, chapter 16
\end{items}

\item Monte Carlo
\begin{items}
\item Wikipedia (German version!) good; english version good but inconcise
\url{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo-Simulation}
\item Best, but perhaps too advanced: \emph{An Introduction to MCMC for Machine Learning} \url{https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~arnaud/andrieu_defreitas_doucet_jordan_intromontecarlomachinelearning.pdf}

\item Sampling in general: Bishop Chapter 11
\item Russel \& Norwig mentions Monte Carlo simulation, but not very helpful
\end{items}

\item Linear Regression
\begin{items}
\item Hastie section 2.3 \url{https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/}
\item own script: \href{https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-MachineLearning.pdf}{Introduction to Machine Learning}, section 2
\end{items}

\item MDPs, Value Iteration \& Reinforcement Learning
\begin{items}
\item Sutton \& Barto is the standard reference \url{https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf}. Chapter 4 for basics on MDPs \& Value Iteration; Chapters 6 \& 7 are the classics for model-free Reinforcement Learning
\end{items}

\end{itemize}
