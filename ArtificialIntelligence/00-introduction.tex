\item[$\to$] AI is a very broad research field, including a zillion of problem settings, theory \& applications

\item[$\to$] AI research is broadly about understanding and creating all kinds of learning, reasoning, inferring, and deciding systems, as well as understandings the mathematical, statistical, and algorithmic foundations of such systems.

~\pause

\item AI is not about ``creating the one AI machine'' -- it's a broad \emph{science}

\item AI is not about ``recreating human I'', or natural I ~ \emph{(It can be a tool for a science of natural intelligence though.)}

\item AI as \emph{Decision Making}

\begin{items}
\item What's the decision space? (class, colorings, paths, sequences, words)
\item What's the input? (data, model, or both)
\item What's the objective? (loss fct., constraints)

\item For instance: (oversimplified)
\begin{items}
\item ``ML: data $\mapsto$ decision'' \qquad (decision$\equiv$function,  where function: $x$ $\mapsto$ prediction/class/word)
\pause
\item ``reasoning: model $\mapsto$ decision''
\pause
\item ``planning: model $\mapsto$ sequence of decisions''

\cen{What is AI about?}

\item AI research is about \emph{problem formulation}:
\begin{items}
\item e.g.\ novel loss functions, novel archtectures (e.g. GANs, transformers), novel formalizations of problems (e.g.\ LGP)
\item Transferring ``problem ideas'' to concise mathematical definitions
\end{items}

~

\item AI research is about \emph{solvers}:
\begin{items}
\item optimization algos, search algos, probabilistic inference algos, logic solvers
\end{items}

~

\item[1)] AI is about decision making, both, \emph{model-based} (reasoning/planning) and \emph{data-based} (learning)

\item[2)] AI research is about both, creative problem formulations and solvers

~

\item[3)] AI research is a broad science, aiming to understand all kinds of intelligent systems and their foundations (not a race to \emph{the} AI)

%% \item AI is not a thing, not a machine, not a computer program -- it's a research discipline

%% ~

%% \item Common, but not my favorite views:

%% \item ``AI is a discipline trying to reproduce human intelligence''
%% \end{items}

%% }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% \slide{What is Intelligence?}{

%% \small

%% \item First: It is perfectly fine to define an \emph{intelligence research} discipline without having a definition of \emph{intelligence}. For instance:
%% \begin{items}
%% \item Biology as discipline $\oto$ Life as phenomenon
%%  \item AI as discipline $\oto$ Intelligence as phenomenon
%%  \end{items}

%% \pause

%% \item The Berlin Reserach Cluster \emph{Science of Intelligence} is exactly about this -- including diverse discussions/views on what intelligence is. Rather than arguing about the ``right'' definition, it is much more fruitful to state a series of concrete partial/disciplinary/limiting definitions, as stable reference for discussion


%% ~\pause

%% \item One such concrete definition that I find important as reference:

%% \emph{Intelligence measures the degree to which a "system can control" its environment and itself into "any desired state".}

%% \begin{items}
%% \item Reflects very much the control and decision making perspective
%% \item Raises questions about whether the notion of "control" (the decision space) is apriori given; whether "desired" has to be given by another normative faculty (implies that intellgence relates to \emph{any} desireds and is independent of norms); about the notion of "state"
%% \end{items}

%% }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% \slide{AI = ML?}{

%% \item We'll discuss this in more detail in later lectures...

%% ~

%% \item ML is of course a core topic of AI research -- but it is naive to state ``AI = ML''

%% {\tiny (e.g., supervised ML can be viewed as a ``single-decision process'', making a single decision about the predictive function $f\in\HH$ in the hypothesis space $\HH$ -- but no interactive process or sequential decision process is considered.)

%% }

%% \pause

%% \item ML (esp.\ function optimization) is a crucial \emph{tool} throughout various AI problems (e.g.\ to approximate a Q-function or system dynamics).)

%% ~\pause

%% \item From a broader AI perspective, instead of distinguishing ``modern ML'' from ``old-fasioned AI'', it is better to equally speak of:

%% \centering

%% \emph{data-based decision making}

%% \emph{model-based decision making}


%% %% \item In large parts, ML is: \quad (let's call this ML$^0$)

%% %% \cen{\emph{Fitting a function $f: x\mapsto y$ to given data $D=\{ (x_i,y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$}}

%% %% ~\pause

%% %% \item And what does that have to do with AI?

%% %% \item Literally, not much:
%% %% \begin{items}
%% %% \item The decision made by a ML$^0$ method is only a single decision: Decide on the function $f\in\HH$ in the hypothesis space $\HH$

%% %% \item This ``single-decision process'' is not interactive; ML$^0$ does not formalize/model/consider how the choice of $f$ changes the world

%% %% \item The objective $\LL(f, D)$ in ML$^0$ depends only on the given static data $D$ and the decision $f$, not how $f$ might change the world

%% %% \item ``Learning'' in ML$^0$ is not an interactive process, but some method to pick $f$ on the basis of the static $D$. The typically iterative optimization process is not the decision process that ML$^0$ focusses on.
%% %% \end{items}

%% }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% \slide{}{

%% \textbf{But,} function approximation can be used to help solving AI (interactive decision process) problems:

%% \item Building a trained/fixed $f$ into an interacting system based on human expert knowledge

%% {\tiny E.g., an engineer trains a NN $f$ to recognize street signs based on
%% a large fixed data set $D$. S/he builds $f$ into a car to drive
%% autonomously. That car certainly solves an AI problem; $f$
%% continuously makes decisions that change the state of the world. But
%% $f$ was never optimized literally for the task of interacting with the
%% world; it was only optimized to minimze a loss on the static data
%% $D$. It is not a priori clear that minimizing the loss of $f$ on $D$
%% is related to maximizing rewards in car driving. That fact is the
%% expertise of the engineer; it is not some AI algorithm that discovered
%% that fact. At no place there was an AI method that ``learns to drive a
%% car''. There was only an optimization method to minimize the loss of
%% $f$ on $D$.

%% }

%% \item Using ML in interactive decision processes

%% {\tiny
%% E.g., to approximate a $Q$-function, state evaluation function, reward
%% function, the system dynamics, etc. Then, other AI methods can use
%% these approximate models to actually take decisions in the interactive
%% context.
