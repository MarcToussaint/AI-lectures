\story{
In this lecture discuss the term Explainable AI, with emphasis on ML. We follow the concept of counterfactuals, and generally discuss what kind of counterfactual test one could make to explain ML predictions. As a little detour, this is  related to sensitivity analysis in optimization and we mention the basic theory on this.

As specific instances we discuss, e.g., relevance propagation, feature
inversion, and influence functions. We conclude to highlighting the
difference to post-hoc rationalization and the claim that ``white
box'' models would be more explainable.

\item Exhaustiv counterfactual analysis it very expensive

\item Many approaches investigate small (variational) changes of input
\begin{items}
\item Roughly: analyze the total deriviative $\frac{dy}{d\t}$ of the prediction w.r.t.\ any input parameter
\item Sensitivity Analysis

\slide{Sensitivity Analysis in Optimization}{

\item Consider a general problem $$x^* = \argmin_x f(x) \st g(x)\le0,~ h(x)=0$$
\begin{items}
\item where $x\in\RRR^n,~ f:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR,~ g:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR^m,~ h:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR^{m'}$, all smooth
\item First compute the optimum
\item Then explain the optimum

\item Counterfactuals: How would the solution be different if $f,g,h$ were different?

\slide{The KKT Implicit Function}{

{\tiny [From the Optimization Algorithms course...]

}\small

\item Consider a \textbf{parameterized} problem $$x^*(\t) = \argmin_x f(\t,x) \st g(\t,x)\le0,~ h(\t,x)=0$$

\item We define the \textbf{implicit function} $F: \t \mapsto (x,\k,\l) \st r(\t,x,\k,\l)=0$ for the KKT
\begin{align*}
& r(\t,x,\k,\l) = 
\mat{c}{
\na {~} [f(\t,x) + \l^\T g(\t,x) + \k^\T h(\t,x)] \\
h(\t,x) \\
\diag(\l) g(\t,x)
}
\end{align*}
(i.e., for any $\t$, $F$ outputs the primal and dual solution to the KKT conditions.)

\item In particular, we have $r(\t,F(\t))=0$ and therefore
$$
\Del \t r + \Del {{}_{x\k\l}} r~ \Del \t F = 0
\quad\To\quad
\Del \t F = -[\Del {{}_{x\k\l}} r]^\1~ \Del \t r ~.

simply scrutinizing the inference process.''
