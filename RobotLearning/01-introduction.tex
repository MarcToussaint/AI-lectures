\slide{What is this lecture about?}{

\item Module description (Moses 41016) -- Learning Outcomes
\begin{items}\ttiny
\item The students have a systematic understanding of the wide variety of contexts and problems settings in which machine learning methods can be applied within robotics.
\item They understand how the learning problems are mathematically formulated in these settings.
\item{} [They also learn about underlying ML methods to tackle these problems.]\dots
%% \item They can decide which kinds of learning methods are applicable and appropriate for which kinds of problem settings.
%% \item They can transfer advances in machine learning to applications in robotics.
%% \item They have first experience with some basic learning methods applied to robotics problems.
\end{items}

\item Content
\begin{items}\ttiny
\item The term Robot Learning generally denotes the use of learning methods in the context of robotics, which is ubiquitous in modern robotics research. This course aims to provide a systematic introduction to the field, in particular to the various contexts and problem setting where machine learning can be applied and the specific learning methods themselves. This includes topics such as:

\item System identification, model learning, residual model learning
\item Imitation learning, behavior cloning, learning from demonstration
\item Reinforcement Learning (RL), skill learning, offline RL
\item Constraint learning, grasp learning, iterative learning control
\item Learning to predict plans, learning to warmstart MPC or optimization
\item Inverse RL
\item \dots
%% \item Learning as optimization, in-situ learning/trial-and-error vs. offline optimization
%% \item Evolutionary learning
%% \item Online/lifelong learning
%% \item Safe Learning
%% \item Multi-robot learning
\end{items}

\slide{Assignments \& Exam}{

\item Tutorial exercises are a mix of analytic and coding problems. \textbf{Voting System:}
\begin{items}
\item When attending a tutorial, students mark in an ISIS questionnaire which exercises they have worked on
\item Students are randomly selected to present their solutions (no need for correct solutions -- just something to present and discuss)
\item When not attending: upload pdf notes/solutions on ISIS
\end{items}

~

\item \textbf{Exam prerequisite:}
\begin{items}
\item at least 50\% votes in the exercises
%\item at least 50\% points in the hand-in coding assignments
%\item[] \emph{(Moses: Bestehen der benoteten Programmier- und Hausaufgaben)}
\end{items}

~

\item The written exam will be about analytical problems, determines final grade (no portfolio)
