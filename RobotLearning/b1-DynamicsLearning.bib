	abstract = {Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning ({RL}) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-speciﬁc knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or speciﬁc knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art {RL} our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.},

	abstract = {Autonomous racing is a critical research area for autonomous driving, presenting signiﬁcant challenges in vehicle dynamics modeling, such as balancing model precision and computational efﬁciency at high speeds ({\textgreater}280 km/h), where minor errors in modeling have severe consequences. Existing physics-based models for vehicle dynamics require elaborate testing setups and tuning, which are hard to implement, time-intensive, and cost-prohibitive. Conversely, purely data-driven approaches do not generalize well and cannot adequately ensure physical constraints on predictions. This letter introduces Deep Dynamics, a physics-constrained neural network ({PCNN}) for autonomous racecar vehicle dynamics modeling. It merges physics coefﬁcient estimation and dynamical equations to accurately predict vehicle states at high speeds. A unique Physics Guard layer ensures internal coefﬁcient estimates remain within their nominal physical ranges. Open-loop and closed-loop performance assessments, using a physics-based simulator and full-scale autonomous Indy racecar data, highlight Deep Dynamics as a promising approach for modeling racecar vehicle dynamics.},

In this letter, a new method is introduced which allows the identiﬁcation of the propeller coefﬁcients and dynamic parameters of a quadrotor in a single procedure. It is based on a Total-Least-Square identiﬁcation technique, does not require any speciﬁc test bench and needs only a measurement of the mass of the quadrotor and a recording of data from a ﬂight that can be performed manually by an operator. Because the symmetries of classic quadrotors limit the performance of the algorithm, an extension of the procedure is proposed. Two types of ﬂights are then used: one with the initial quadrotor and a second ﬂight with an additional payload on the vehicle that modiﬁes the mass distribution. This new procedure, which is valiyeard experimentally, increases the performance of the identiﬁcation and allows an estimation of all the relevant dynamic parameters of the quadrotor near hovering conditions.},

            Accurate models of mechanical system dynamics are often critical for model‐based control and reinforcement learning. Fully data‐driven dynamics models promise to ease the process of modeling and analysis, but require considerable amounts of data for training and often do not generalize well to unseen parts of the state space. Combining data‐driven modeling with prior analytical knowledge is an attractive alternative as the inclusion of structural knowledge into a regression model improves the model's data efficiency and physical integrity. In this article, we survey supervised regression models that combine rigid‐body mechanics with data‐driven modeling techniques. We analyze the different latent functions (such as kinetic energy or dissipative forces) and operators (such as differential operators and projection matrices) underlying common descriptions of rigid‐body mechanics. Based on this analysis, we provide a unified view on the combination of data‐driven regression models, such as neural networks and Gaussian processes, with analytical model priors. Furthermore, we review and discuss key techniques for designing structured models such as automatic differentiation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396},
	abstract = {A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including {RNNs}, {CNNs}, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of \$10000\$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model ({SSM}) {\textbackslash}( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) {\textbackslash}), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the {SSM}, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the {SSM} to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on sequential {CIFAR}-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D {ResNet}, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation \$60{\textbackslash}times\$ faster (iii) {SoTA} on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.},

	abstract = {Recently non-linear control methods like Model Predictive Control ({MPC}) and Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) have attracted increased interest in the quadrotor control community. In contrast to classic control methods like cascaded {PID} controllers, {MPC} and {RL} heavily rely on an accurate model of the system dynamics. The process of quadrotor system identification is notoriously tedious and is often pursued with additional equipment like a thrust stand. Furthermore, low-level details like motor delays which are crucial for accurate end-to-end control are often neglected. In this work, we introduce a data-driven method to identify a quadrotor's inertia parameters, thrust curves, torque coefficients, and first-order motor delay purely based on proprioceptive data. The estimation of the motor delay is particularly challenging as usually, the {RPMs} can not be measured. We derive a Maximum A Posteriori ({MAP})-based method to estimate the latent time constant. Our approach only requires about a minute of flying data that can be collected without any additional equipment and usually consists of three simple maneuvers. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately recover the parameters of multiple quadrotors. It also facilitates the deployment of {RL}-based, end-to-end quadrotor control of a large quadrotor under harsh, outdoor conditions.},

Especially for highly dynamic flights, model-based estimation and control combined with a good simulation framework is key. While detailed models are available in the literature, measuring the model parameters can be a time-consuming task and requires access to special equipment or facilities. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to accurately estimate physical parameters based on a maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimation scheme. Unlike many current methods, we make direct use of both raw inertial measurement unit measurements and the rotor speeds of the {MAV}. We also estimate the spatial-temporal alignment to a modular pose sensor. The proposed {ML}-based approach finds the parameters that best explain the sensor readings and also provides an estimate of their uncertainty. Although we derive the proposed method for use with an {MAV}, the approach is kept general and can be extended to other sensors or flying platforms. Extensive evaluation on simulated data and on real-world experimental data demonstrates that the approach yields accurate estimates and exhibits a large region of convergence. Furthermore, we show that the estimation can be performed using only on-board sensing, requiring no external infrastructure.},
