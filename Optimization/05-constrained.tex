\key{Constrained optimization}
\slide{Problem Formulation}{

\item General \defn{Non-linear Mathematical Program (NLP)} (constrained optimization problem):

Let $x\in\RRR^n$, $f:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR$, $g:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR^m$,
$h:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR^l$ find
$$ \min_x~ f(x) \st g(x)\le 0,~ h(x) = 0 $$
\begin{items}
\item We typically assume $f,g,h$ to be differentiable or smooth.
\item We can typically query $f,\na f, g, \na g, h, \na h$, optionally also $\he f$.
\end{items}

~

~\small

\item The lecture sometimes only mentions inequality constraints $g$,
equality constraints are analogous/easier

%% ~

%% \item Applications

%% -- Find an optimal, non-colliding trajectory in robotics

%% -- Optimize the shape of a turbine blade, s.t.\ it must not break

%% -- Optimize the train schedule, s.t.\ consistency/possibility

\slide{General approaches}{

\item Roughly, try to somehow transform the constraint problem to
\begin{items}
\item a series of unconstraint problems ~ (log-barrier, AugLag, etc...)
\item a single but larger unconstraint problem ~ (primal-dual)
\item a (series of) other constraint problems, hopefully simpler ~ (dual, convex, SQP)
\end{items}

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Outline}{

\item KKT conditions of optimality

\item Core methods: \textbf{log barrier}, squared penalties, \textbf{Aug.\ Lagrangian}

\item Introduce \textbf{Lagrangian} -- revisit KKT, log barrier, dual problem, primal-dual

\item Further topics: Phase I, bound constraints, trust region, distributed optimization, simplex algorithm

\slide{Solving by sketching}{

\item Sketch the following problems and identify the solution:

\begin{items}
\item 1-dimensional: $\min x \st  \sin(x) = 0,~ x^2/4-1 \le 0$,
\item 2-dimensional: $\min x_1 \st x^2 + y^2-1 \le 0$
\end{items}

\item \textbf{Theorem (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions):} For any NLP,
\begin{align*}
x \text{~optimal~} \quad\To\quad \exists \l\in\RRR^m, \k\in\RRR^l \st& \nonumber\\
\na f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \l_i \na g_i(x) + \sum_{j=1}^l \k_j \na h_j(x) &= 0
 && \text{(stationarity)}\\
h(x)=0 \comma  g(x) &\le 0 && \text{(primal feasibility)}\\
\l &\ge 0  && \text{(dual feasibility)}\\
\forall_i:~ \l_i g_i(x) &= 0 && \text{(complementarity)}
\end{align*}

{\small [stationarity in compact notation: $\na f(x) + \l^\T \del_x g(x) + \k^\T \del_x h(x) = 0$]

}

%% \item For optimal $x$ it must hold (necessary condition):~ $\exists_\l \st$
%% \begin{align*}
%% \na f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \l_i \na g_i(x) &= 0 && \text{(``stationarity'')}\\
%% \forall_i:~ g_i(x) &\le 0 && \text{(primal feasibility)}\\
%% \forall_i:~ \l_i &\ge 0  && \text{(dual feasibility)}\\
%% \forall_i:~ \l_i g_i(x) &= 0 && \text{(complementary)}
%% \end{align*}

\slide{Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions}{\label{lastpage}

\item \defn{Stationarity (1st KKT)}: ``Force balance'' of the
  cost pulling and the active constraints pushing back
\begin{items}
\item Existence of dual parameters $\l,\k$ is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
\na f (x) \in \Span \{ \na g_{1..m}, \na h_{1..l}\}
\end{align*}
\item The values of $\l$ and $\k$ ~ $\oto$ ~ how strongly the
  constraints push
  \end{items}

~\pause

\item \defn{Complementarity (4th KKT)}: ``Logic of constraint activity''
\begin{items}
\item An inequality can only push at the boundary, where $g_i=0$
\item The formulation $\l_i g_i=0$ very elegantly describes this logic
\item The combinatorics of which constraint is active ($O(2^m)$) is a core source of difficulty of constrained optimization
\item If you would apriori know which constraints are active $\to$ inequalities become equalities $\to$ easier
\end{items}
