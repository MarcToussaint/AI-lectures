\slide{Why is Optimization interesting?}{

%% \item {\small
%% In an otherwise unfortunate interview I've been asked why ``we guys''
%% (AI, ML, optimal control people) always talk about
%% optimality. ``People are by no means optimal'', the interviewer
%% said. I think that statement pinpoints the whole misunderstanding of
%% the role and concept of optimality principles.}


\item \emph{Optimality principles are a means of scientific and engineering
description}

\item It is often easier to describe a thing (natural or artifical)
via an optimality priciple than directly

\item Almost any scientific field uses optimality principles to
describe nature \& artifacts
\begin{items}
\item Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mechanics, ...
\item Operations research, scheduling, ...
\item Computer Vision, Speach Recognition, Machine Learning, Robotics, AI, ...
\end{items}

~

\item Endless applications

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Teaching optimization}{

\item Optimization includes largely different approaches/formalisms:
\begin{items}
\item Standard continuous, convex or non-linear optimization
\item Discrete Optimization
\item Global Optimization
\item Stochastic Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms, Swarm optimization, etc
\end{items}

~\mypause

\item This lecture focusses on continuous, convex or non-linear optimization

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Optimization Problems}{

\item Generic optimization problem, also called \textbf{Mathematical Program}:

\medskip

Let $x\in\RRR^n,~ f:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR,~ g:~ \RRR^n \to \RRR^m,~
h: \RRR^n\to\RRR^l$. Find
$$\min_x f(x) \st  g(x)\le 0,~ h(x)=0$$

\pause
\small

\item \textbf{Blackbox}: only $f(x)$ can be evaluated

\item \textbf{Gradient}: $\na f(x)$ can be evaluated

{\tiny
\item Gauss-Newton type: $f(x) = \phi(x)^\T \phi(x)$ and
$\na \phi(x)$ can be evaluated
}

\item \textbf{Stochastic Gradient}: only ``samples of $\na f(x)$'' can be evaluated efficiently

\item \textbf{2nd order}: $\he f(x)$ can be evaluated

\item Approximate methods:
\begin{items}
\item Use samples of $f(x)$ to approximate $\na f(x)$ locally
\item Use samples of $\na f(x)$ to approximate $\he f(x)$ locally
\end{items}

}

\end{items}

\item Part 2: Algorithms for constrained optimization:
\begin{items}

\slide{Assignments \& Exam}{

\item Voting System for the exercise sheets:
\begin{items}
\item Before attending the tutorial, students mark in an ISIS
questionnaire which exercises they have worked on
\item Students are randomly selected to present their solutions (no need for correct solutions -- just something to present and discuss)
\item When not attending: upload pdf notes/solutions on ISIS
\end{items}

~

\item \textbf{Exam prerequisites:}
\begin{items}
\item at least 50\% votes in the exercises, and
\item at least 50\% points in the hand-in coding assignments
%\item[] \emph{(Moses: Bestehen der benoteten Programmier- und
%Hausaufgaben)}

\medskip

(If you fulfilled these prerequisites last year, you don't have to
redo them.)
\end{items}

\item The written exam will be about analytical problems, determines final grade (no portfolio)
